VMap ToDos

- Should you provide methods for getting sets of keys and values?
  Maybe you should only provide the ability to get an iterator.

- Add a method to prune a map or set.
  It should remove all old VersionValue objects
  so that each VMapEntry has only one VersionValue,
  change the version to 1 in all VersionValue objects,
  and change the version of the map or set to 1.
