    <h1>A Hash Table for Functional Programming</h1>
    <p class="author">
      by<br/>

      R. Mark Volkmann, Partner
      <br/>Object Computing, Inc. (OCI)
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This article is about an idea that came to me during a
      two-hour drive from Columbia, Missouri to St. Charles.
      I was deep in thought about functional programming
      and the issues with using maps in that setting.
      And then it hit me ... a new kind of hash table!
    </p>

    <h2>Some Basics</h2>
    <p>
      Hash tables provide a way to store key/value pairs
      and quickly look up values by key.
      Only one value per key can be stored,
      although the value can be a collection of values.
      Sets are collections that do not allow duplicate elements and
      typically provide a way to quickly determine whether
      they contain a given element.
      A set collection can be implemented using a hash table,
      storing elements as the keys and ignoring the values.
      For this reason, when discussing details of maps and sets
      in this article, I will tend to only mention maps for brevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another name for "hash table" is "hash map"
      and many people simply use the term "map.
      Likewise, many people refer to a "hash set" simply as a "set".
      So that's what I'll do in this article.
    </p>

    <h2>Notes On My Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      The hash table was invented in 1953.
      It seems inconceivable that the variation described in this article
      hasn't been conceived and publicized in the 58 years that followed.
      I searched the web for a similar idea and did not find one.
      Perhaps a reader will notify me that
      my design is similar to an existing one.
      Please let me know if that is the case.
      I can be reached at "mark at ociweb dot com".
    </p>
    <p>
      I chose Java for the first implementation only because I felt
      more confident in creating a working, tested implemenation using it.
      However, since Java is not a functional programming language,
      Java developers may not be convinced of the value in using
      the new map/set implementations presented here.
      Users of functional languages such as
      Lisp (include Clojure, Common Lisp, and Scheme) and Scala
      will likely be more interested.
    </p>

    <h2>Functional Programming</h2>
    <p>
      Functional programming is a style of programming where code
      is divided into functions rather than classes and methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an emphasis on writing "pure functions".
      These do not access global state and do not cause side effects.
      Not accessing global state means they only use data
      passed to them via arguments.
      Calling the same function later with the same arguments
      will produce the same result.
      Not causing side effects means they do not
      modify global state, modify arguments, or produce any output.
      They only return a value.
      Pure functions are easier to understand and test.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's an example of a pure function in Java that operates on a map.
    </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">
      Add an example here!
    </pre>
    <p>
      Any useful program needs at least one function that has a side-effect.
      Otherwise there will be no evidence that the code ever ran.
    </p>

    <h2>Map Keys</h2>
    <p>
      The objects used as keys in maps and elements in sets
      must satisfy two criteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, key objects must support a method to determine
      whether they are "equal" to another object.
      In Java, this is the <code>equals</code> method.
      For example, a "Car" object might determine whether it is
      equal to another object by verifying that
      the other object is a Car object and
      comparing make, model, year and color.
      Alternatively, it might only compare VIN numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, key objects must support a method for
      computing a "hash code" value.
      In Java, this is the <code>hashCode</code> method.
      A hash code is an integer that is computed based on
      the properties of the object that make it unique,
      such as make, model, year and color.
      It is important for hash code values to be well-distributed.
      If many objects have the same hash code value,
      lookups based on them will be slow.
      The reason for this will be made clear soon.
    </p>

    <h2>Maps and Functional Programming</h2>
    <p>
      Typical implementations of maps are mutable.
      New key/value pairs can be added and existing pairs can be removed.
      This is of course an issue for functional programming.
      To fix this, we need an implementation that is immutable.
      But what good is a map that cannot be changed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose all the methods that typically mutate the map
      instead return a new map that has the same content
      as the original, but with the requested change made.
      Creating the new one by copying the original would be too slow,
      especially for large maps.
      What we need is a way to allow new maps to
      share data with the ones from which they were created,
      but do so in a way that prevents code
      with references to the original versions
      from seeing the changes made in the new ones.
      In a sense, the maps are logically, but not technically immutable.
      Of course we also need lookups to remain fast.
    </p>

    <h2>How Maps Work</h2>
    <p>
      Many readers will already be familiar with the material in this section.
      Feel free to skip ahead to "Versioned Maps and Sets".
    </p>
    <p>
      In typical map implementations, key/value pairs
      are stored in objects referred to as "map entries".
      Map entries are stored in linked lists referred to as "chains".
      Heads of the chains are stored in "buckets",
      which are typically implemented using arrays.
      The bucket for a particular map entry is determined by computing
      the modulo of the hash code for the key by the number of buckets.
      Chains are needed to manage "hash collisions" which occur when
      more than one key, and therefore map entry, ends up in the same bucket.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the diagram below, three key/values pairs have been added to a map.
      The map currently has seven buckets.
    </p>
    <div><img src="MapInternals.png" alt="Map internals"/></div>

    <h3>Adding Data</h3>
    <p>
      When each key/value pair is added, the following things happen:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>the hash code of the key is computed</li>
      <li>the modulo of the hash code and the number of buckets
        is used to determine the bucket of the chain
        in which the map entry will be added</li>
      <li>a map entry is created to hold the hash code,
        key object reference and value object reference</li>
      <li>the map entry is inserted at the beginning of the chain
        and the next pointers of the map entry objects
        are updated accordingly
        (can insert anywhere; inserting at beginning
        favors lookup of recently added keys)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      As an example, suppose we want to add the key "foo" to a map
      that currently has seven buckets (numbered zero through six).
      The hash code that Java returns for "foo" is 101574.
      101574 mod 7 is 4 so bucket 4 is used.
    </p>

    <h3>Retrieving Data</h3>
    <p>
      When the value corresponding to a given key is requested,
      the following things happen:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>the hash code of the key is computed</li>
      <li>the modulo of the hash code and the number of buckets
        is used to determine the bucket of the chain
        in which the map entry resides</li>
      <li>the chain for the selected bucket is searched to find
        a key object that is equal to the specified key object</li>
      <li>once a match is found,
        the corresponding value object is returned</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Removing Data</h3>
    <p>
      When a key/value pair is removed,
      the steps are nearly identical to retrieving a value.
      Rather than returning the value at the end,
      the map entry is removed from its chain.
    </p>

    <h3>Rehashing</h3>
    <p>
      As the number of entries increases, the liklihood of
      chains containing more than one entry increases.
      This has an adverse impact on lookup performance
      since the chains require a sequential search.
    <p>
    </p>
      The "load factor" is the ratio of entries to buckets.
      Many implementations perform a "rehash" when
      the load factor reaches a number around 0.75.
      The goal of a rehash is to return to the map to
      a state where most chains contain only one map entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rehash creates a new, larger bucket array.
      A good new size is double the previous size plus one.
      The entries from the old bucket array are moved to the new one
      by computing their new bucket index (hash-code mod bucket-array-length)
      and adding the entry to the front of the chain for that bucket.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a rehash completes, the old bucket array can be garbage collected.
      The entries are not garbage collected because
      they are still referenced from the new bucket array.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the approximiate number of entries to be added is known in advance,
      an appropriate initial bucket array length can be selected
      so the liklihood that a rehash will be needed is nearly eliminated.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Poorly Distributed Hash Codes</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine what would happen the computed hash code
      for many of the keys was the same.
      Their map entry objects would all end up in the same chain.
      Retrieving the value for a key would still work,
      but it would be slow because it would require
      a linear search through a long chain.
      This points out the importance of computing
      well-distributed hash codes.
    </p>

    <h3>Modifying Key Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine what would happen if the properties of a key object
      were modified after it was added to a map.
      The computed hash code for the object could change.
      This would mean that the map entry for the key
      may no longer be in the correct chain.
      An attempt to lookup the corresponding value for the key
      would likely fail because it would select the wrong bucket
      and therefore search the wrong chain.
      This points out the importance of not modifying key objects
      after they have been added to a map.
    </p>

    <h2>Versioned Maps and Sets</h2>
    <p>
      The new map/set collections I have implemented are
      able to create new versions from existing collections.
      The new versions share memory with previous versions,
      but in a way that doesn't expose changes to the previous versions.
    </p>

    <h2>VMap and VSet Interfaces</h2>
    <p>
      The diagram below shows the methods in the VMap and VSet interfaces.
      It also shows implementations of those interfaces, VHashMap and VHashSet.
      Both utilize the class InternalMap which is responsible for storing
      the array of buckets which stores chains of map entries.
    </p>
    <div><img src="VMapClassDiagram.png" alt="VMap class diagram"/></div>
    <p>
      A major difference between typical map/set implementations
      and this one is that the map entries contain
      a reference to a linked list of version/value objects,
      rather than a single value object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each VHashMap and VHashSet object has a version and a version set.
      When a new VHashMap/VHashSet object is created, its version is zero
      and it has no version set.
      When a mutating method is called
      on a VHashMap (put, delete or clear),
      a new VHashMap is created using the next available version number.
      Likewise, when a mutating method is called
      on a VHashSet (add, delete or clear),
      a new VHashSet is created using the next available version number. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The version set is a bit array that
      describes the ancestry of the collection.
      The version set for each of the new collections described above
      will be the same as that its source collection,
      but with the bit set for its version.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the example below:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>an empty map named map0 is created</li>
      <li>map1 is created from map0, adding the key "red"</li>
      <li>map2 is created from map1, adding the key "green"</li>
      <li>map3 is created from map1, adding the key "blue"</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      map0 remains empty.<br/>
      map1 only contains the key "red".<br/>
      map2 only contains the keys "red" and "green".<br/>
      map3 only contains the keys "red" and "blue".
    </p>
    <p>
      map0 has no version set since it contains no values,
      but can be thought of as "1".<br/>
      map1 has the version set "11" which indicates that it includes
      all values with a version of one or zero.<br/>
      map2 has the version set "111" which indicates that it includes
      all values with a version of two, one or zero.<br/>
      map3 has the version set "1011" which indicates that it includes
      all values with a version of three, one or zero.
    </p>
    <div><img src="VMapObjects.png" alt="VMap objects"/></div>

    <h2>VHashMap and VHashSet Implementations</h2>
    <p>
      VHashMap and VHashSet objects are fairly lightweight.
      They contain a version number,
      a bit array for storing version ancestery and
      a reference to an internal map that is
      shared with all ancestors and descendents.
    </p>
    <div><img src="VMapInternals.png" alt="VMap internals"/></div>
    <p>
      In the Java implementation, the bit array is
      represented by a java.util.BitSet object.
      This is the only Java collection class used in the Java implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      While VMaps and VSets are immutable,
      the key/value objects added to them may not be.
      Since a primary use case for these new collection types
      is to use them in the context of functional programming,
      it is important for the key/value objects to also be immutable.
      These new collection types cannot enforce that,
      so it becomes the responsibility of developers to ensure this.
    </p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">
      VMap<String, Integer> map0 = new VHashMap<String, Integer>();
      // map0 is empty.

      VMap<String, Integer> map1 = map0.put("foo", 1);
      // map0 is still emtpy.
      // map1 only contains the key "foo".

      VMap<String, Integer> map2 = map1.put("bar", 2);
      // map0 is still emtpy.
      // map1 still only contains the key "foo".
      // map2 contains the keys "foo" and "bar".

      VMap<String, Integer> map3 = map2.delete("foo");
      // map0 is still emtpy.
      // map1 still only contains the key "foo".
      // map2 still contains the keys "foo" and "bar".
      // map3 only contains the key "bar".

      VMap<String, Integer> map4 = map3.put("bar", 3);
      // map0 is still emtpy.
      // map1 still only contains the key "foo".
      // map2 still contains the keys "foo" and "bar".
      // map3 still only contains the key "bar".
      // map4 contains the key "bar",
      // but with a different value than in map2.

      VMap<String, Integer> map5 = map4.put("foo", 4);
      // map0 is still emtpy.
      // map1 still only contains the key "foo".
      // map2 still contains the keys "foo" and "bar".
      // map3 still only contains the key "bar".
      // map4 still contains the key "bar",
      // but with a different value than in map2.
      // map5 contains the keys "foo" and "bar",
      // but "foo" has a different value than in map1 and map2.
    </pre>
    <p>
      Multiple values can be added at once to avoid creating a new version
      for each added value.
    </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">
      VSet<String> set1 = new VHashSet<String>("red", "orange", "yellow");
      VSet<String> set2 = set.add("green", "blue", "purple");
      // set2 contains all six colors.

    <p>
      The following example demonstrates using a Map in a functional way.
    </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">
      Add code example here!
    </pre>

    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <p>
      VMaps and VSets consume more memory than normal maps and sets
      since they contain version/value chains instead of a single value
      in each map entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding key/value pairs to VMaps and adding values to VSets
      have similar performance to these operations on normal maps and sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Retrieving values from VMaps and
      testing whether a values are contained in VSets
      are slower than these operations on normal maps and sets.
      This is because version/value chains must be searched
      instead of simply accessing a single value in a map entry
      as is done with normal maps and sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearing a VMap is much slower than clearing a normal map.
      Explain why!
    </p>
    <p>
      Like typical map implementations, performance will be poor
      if hash code values of the keys used are not well-distributed.
      This will cause the chains to become long
      which will make lookups slower.
    </p>

    <h2>Generics</h2>
    <p>
      My initial implementation did not support Java generics.
      VMaps and VSets could hold any type of object.
      After getting the code to pass all my tests
      I modified it to use generics so that VMaps and VSets
      holding specific kinds of objects could be created.
      The code was a thing of beauty before adding generics
      and is less so now.  ;-)
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Here is how to include blocks of code in the article using the
      &lt;pre&gt; tag:
    </p>

    <pre xml:space="preserve">
    import java.io.*;

    public class Foobar extends Whatever {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            <span class="green">// 4-space indent according to JavaSoft conventions</span>
        }
    }
    </pre>

    <p>Now describe the code.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
    Wrap things up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tip: avoid &amp;nbsp; for indentation. When specific indentation is
      required (usually for code examples), use a &lt;pre&gt; block
      instead.
    </p>

    <h2>References</h2>
    <p>
      Providing references is a good idea. Be sure to spell out the URLs,
      including the protocol, so people can print the article and see the
      addresses.
